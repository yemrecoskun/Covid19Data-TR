Application that displays our described Corona data and creates a data graphic.

## Software Architecture and Principle
### Our project works with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) layered architecture.
- Model Layer;[Covid19.cs](https://github.com/yemrecoskun/Covid19Data-TR/blob/master/Covid19TR/Covid19TR/Model/Covid19.cs) we create the class.
- ViewModel Layer; [Covid19ViewModel.cs](https://github.com/yemrecoskun/Covid19Data-TR/blob/master/Covid19TR/Covid19TR/ViewModel/Covid19ViewModel.cs) Model data (Covid data) that will go to View in the class we created
We rotate. Covid data comes from Web_Api_TR.json. Json operations are used.
- View Layer; [Covid19View.xaml](https://github.com/yemrecoskun/Covid19Data-TR/blob/master/Covid19TR/Covid19TR/View/MainPage.xaml) We add the interface parts of our application to View.
We pull data from the ViewModel into the interface.

### Veri GrafiÄŸi 
- When we pull out the data api We create the data graph using [Charts](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/microcharts-elegant-cross-platform-charts-for-any-app/).
